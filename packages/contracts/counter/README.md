# Counter

This very simple smart contract has no utility for us. It's just here for you to test your development environment. Consider it as a kind of hello-world for TON smart contracts. 

## compile

```bash
npx func-js counter.fc --boc counter.cell
```

## Test and Deploy

go to [counter package readme](../../counter/README.md)
